Simple three panel app to edit a "flock" which has "animals" which have "events".

Data is stored as JSON. Reports will be displayed in the browser.

The long term plan is to store the JSON in the cloud to allow sharing across devices.

There are lots of bugs. The architecture is still in flux.

`cargo run -- --import ./Sheep\ flock\ records.xlsx` for a demo.
